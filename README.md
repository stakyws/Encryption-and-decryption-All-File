<h4>The first interface we used the RSA algorithm which encrypts all files, whatever they are and of any size, except that when encrypting large files, the interface freezes a little and then returns to normal and the process is completed successfully. As for the second interface, you go to it by pressing the NEXT button, and this interface has many encryption algorithms for texts that I developed, including the Caesar and Avine algorithms found in the last button of the interface CC + AC level III and made them form a very strong algorithm where the user chooses any text file, whether PDF, presentation or anything else, and whether it is in any language, Arabic or English, or whether there are any signs in the texts such as *, #, @, !, %, &, (, ), +, =, | And many of the signals, if they exist, nothing will happen to them and only the texts will be encrypted while preserving the location of the texts, spaces and lines, and the excellent algorithm that comes before it and was developed by me, where I developed the RSA algorithm, which is called RSA New in the second interface, where this algorithm encrypts many texts in English and Arabic at the same time, where all you have to write anything in your head or paste any of the important texts you have, even if it consists of 1,000,000 words in both languages, it will be encrypted in an encrypted text written in the hexadecimal system consisting of only 64 bits, and where when this encrypted text is copied and decrypted, everything that was written before the encryption will be returned without subtracting any letter from the original text.</h4>
